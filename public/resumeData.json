    "bio": "Hi there, my name is Shahanwaz and I am coding for more than 3 years and developing my skills to become a full stack developer with a package more than $100k per annum. I used to do part-time coding while I was completing my schooling and my life was boring but the day when I saw Sonny Sangha aka PAPA REACT making some awesome clones using ReactJS with ease and fun, my whole career had took to different level. Now, my ambitions are more than before just because of Sonny. I really want to thank to him for providing such contents to the community for FREE! Thank You very much dude, hope you cross 1M subscribers just from INDIA.",
